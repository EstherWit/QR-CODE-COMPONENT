## My process
I started by putting the written text in html tags, the I added an image and finally styled it using CSS.
For the CSS I was just throwing in every attribute to see which one will work

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I mostly what I previously learnt from other projects but this is my first time using "object-fit: cover; and overflow: hidden" so i guess I somehow learned how to use a new property.


### Continued development

I'm to open to trying more web development projects.
